	<center style="font-size: 28;">this is an example linked page, <a href="index.html">with a link back home</a></center>
	<p style="font-size: 14; font-family: monospace;">you dont need gay transitions or an infinite scrolling page that has continuous sliding bullshit as you scroll down so you have to sit there like a dick waiting for it (god forbid you have slower than 10mpbs internet). this works. this is readable. this is clear. if i had files for you to download i could easily do them <a href="#">here</a>, but i dont, so thats a dead link.</p>
	<p style="font-size 14;">a good way of laying out your website is with a cler file structure in a sidebar and/or straight up navigating through sections like through a file structure, like <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/economics/">this</a> or <a href="suckless.org">this</a>.
