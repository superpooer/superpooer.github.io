	<h1>this is the best website</h1>
	<p>i am superpooer, you can tell by the url. delivered css is bloat, all sites should be html only with client-side css (or similar) allowed to change font and colours to the user's wishes (i recommend #00cc00 consolas/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DMCAsansserif/comments/cwymo1/cleartype_gdi_dmca_sans_serif_left_vs_microsoft/">DMCAsans</a> on #000000). html natively supports embedded images and videos and links to resources which all browsers can handle, removing css only presents an issue for those who think a website is an art form or something pretentious like that. a website is to deliver information, not to show off how fancy you can draw. if you want to do that, draw a picture and embed it.</p>
