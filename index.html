	<p id="entry-para">I am superpooer, you can tell by the url and the page title. You can probably also tell I enjoy privacy and anonymity, but that I'm a cheapskate so I host this on github. I don't really do much so there's no point looking at my github, unless you want <a href="https://github.com/superpooer/cleansed-tf2-cfgs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best tf2 config possible ever</a>. I do have some <a href="sw-recs.html">software recommendations</a> though, if you want to see if there's something new out there. <a href="site-recs.html">Here's</a> a few sites in the same vein I like that you might want to check out too.</p>
