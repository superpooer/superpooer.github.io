	<p id="entry-para">I am superpooer, you can tell by the url. You can probably also tell I enjoy privacy and anonymity, but that I'm a cheapskate so I host this on github. I don't really do much so there's no point looking at my github, unless you want <a href="https://github.com/superpooer/cleansed-tf2-cfgs">the best tf2 config possible ever</a>.</p>

	<p>some nice links:

		[a lot of the political, social or anything-not-directly-related-to-software views on most or all of the above links are uninteresting or downright insulting, but their combined views on software are generally healthy]
