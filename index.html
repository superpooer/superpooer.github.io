	<h1>this is the best website</h1>
	<p>i am superpooer, you can tell by the url. delivered css is for fags, all sites should be html only with client-side css (or similar) allowed to change font and colours to the user's wishes (i recommend #00cc00 monospace on #000000). html natively supports embedded images and videos and links to resources which all browsers can handle, removing css only presents an issue for those who think a website is an art form or sonething pretentious like that. a website is to deliver information, not to show off how fancy you can draw. if you want to do that, draw a picture and embed it, simple.</p>
